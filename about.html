    <p class="", padding="100px">
      Am Mutatiina Ndyagumanawe Edgar an upcoming future of IT especially Software Engineering expert in Uganda. Am only age 20 years currently, a football and movie fan. <br>
      I support Arsenal Football Club based in North London, England.There are many things that i want to share with you my reader so get a seat and a cup of coffee or any drink you prefer. <br>
      I was born on 10th November, 2003 to Mr.Mujuni Ellyson and Mrs.Mujuni Mary and am a Scorpio(my zodiac sign). I am there fourth child.I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers who love me as I love them. <br>
      I used to write short stories and at times plays in younger ages but later stopped after realizing that in my loving country it is very hard to rise if you don't have connections and as a result <br>
      I shifted my love from writing short stories to writing codes. There are very many people that encouraged me to do the software Engineering.And now I have come to love it more than any other Engineering Courses <br>
      <br><strong><b>Refactory Academy</b></strong> <br>
      <i> I came to know about it from my sister who had been informed by a friend who had a friend doing CSEPYTHON at that time. I then began digging through in order to know more about the Academy on thier differend social media handles. An Applause to the people who created Refactory Academy and to those who are doing the great job of Marketing it. Thank you for your great work because with out you i wouldn't be able to get the chance to be who I am at the point. <br>
      Thank you so much.
      For GOD and my country </i> <br>
