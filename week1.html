    <p>
        This Module was introduced and taught by a lady named <strong><b>NANSUBUGA JULIA</b></strong>and in this week we learnt how to achieve independence from depedence. We learnt how to attain Private victory <br>
        <i><b class="text-center">PRIVATE VICTORY</b></i> <br>
        There are different habits one needs to do in order to attain Private Victory and am going to give you a short insight of this different habits <br>
        <b>Habit 1</b> <br>
        This habit has some principles which are Responsibility, Choice and Accountability. In this habit, we are argued to be pro-active inorder increase our circle of influence. When one is Pro-active, he/she allows him/herself the freedon to choose their responce.
        The freedon to choose has stages {Self-awareness, Imagination, Conscience and Independence} to choose inorder to come out with a nice responce. In this habit, we highly corndem Reactive Responses <br>
        <i><b>Habit 2</b></i> <br>
        This habit teaches use to begign with an end in mind. It also has principles which are vision, commitement and purpose. In this habit we are also asked to define your outcomes before you act. <b><i>NANSUBUGA JULIA</i></b> asked us to create a personal mission statement based on principles of effectiveness and she also asked us {the students} towrite down the people who influenced us in life.And she also asked us to write down an object that represents us and we shared it in different rooms we were asigned in.
        This was imperassive <br>
        <i><b>Habit 3</b></i> <br>
        In this habit, we are supposed to put first thing first and it's principles are focus, Integrety, Displine and Priotisation. We learnt about the four Quardrants which were Q1{effectiveness}, Q2{neccessity}, Q3{distructive}, and Q4{waste}. The big rocks were also on the topic. and we are supposed to see the big picture in everything we plan and do, <b><i>Julia</i></b> advised us to eliminate Q3&Q4 and consetrate on Q1.She also to plan our week each week before the week ends.

    </h1>
    <p>
        This module was introduced and taught by <b><i>SAMSON KAPEYI</i></b> and in this week we learnt how the internet works then introduction to HTML abd CSS and finally we got introduced to Bootstrap.
        <b><i>Samson </i></b> gave use many examples on how to use HTML and CSS and also Bootstrap to create a webpage. <br>
        Week one of Intro-to-software-Engineeringwas mainly a talking week because he mainly gave use the different ways of creating a HTML document and even how to use GIT to save changes and post our work on the cloud. At times he was also helped by our fellow student "GODWILL" to explain and emphasaize some points.It was trulya remarkable journey and I personally managed to learn what you see me doing at the point. <br>
