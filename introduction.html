        <h1>MY STORY</h1>
        <p>Am Mutatiina N.(Ndyagumanawe) Edgar and this is my story about the way am doing currently with the studies at refactory
          <br>I was inspired to do Software Engineering with Python by many people whom am not going to mention due to copy right Permissions
        <br>I came to kow about Refactory Academy from their account on X (twitter) <a href="https://x.com/refactory_acad">RefactoryAcademy</a> and even from my Elder sister
        <br>My time so far at Refactory Academy has been very productive because am learning how to create websites for example the one you are seeing now, am learning new ways on how to respond and act in public and privately.
        For the start, all i can say is that, every thing is fair.
        Below is a table showing the People who are teaching at the point
